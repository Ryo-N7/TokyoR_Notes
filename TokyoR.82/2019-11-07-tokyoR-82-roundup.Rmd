As autumn leaves fall, another TokyoR Meetup! This month's meetup was held at [CyberAgent](https://www.cyberagent.co.jp/), an internet advertising/online media company, in their headquarters in Shibuya, Tokyo.

In line with my previous round up posts:

- [TokyoR #76](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-03-07-tokyoR-76-roundup/)
- [TokyoR #77](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77/)) 
- [TokyoR #78](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-05-31-tokyoR-78-roundup/) 
- [TokyoR #79](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup/)
- [TokyoR #80](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup/)

I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my efforts will help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider R community. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links from other sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic of a certain talk. You can follow __Tokyo.R__ by searching for the [#TokyoR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokyoR) hashtag on Twitter.

Anyways...

Let's get started!

# BeginneR Session

As with every [TokyoR](http://tokyor.connpass.com/) meetup, we began with a set of beginner user focused talks:

- [Importing Data by kotatyamtema]()
- [Data tidying by y__mattu](https://ymattu.github.io/TokyoR82/slide.html#/)
- [Data visualization by kilometer](https://speakerdeck.com/kilometer/tokyo-dot-r-number-82-data-visualization)


# Main Talks

## [u_ribo](https://twitter.com/u_ribo): RStudio environment for data analysis!
* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/hoxo_m/shiny-177170789)

introduction to a number of packages that help with controlling your data analysis environment 

- R and Python in the same environment
-- using the RStudio IDE v.1.2.5 (as of July)
- ability to use Python + SQL >>> matplotlib can be show in the "plots" panel
- {reticulate} pkg
- new panels: Connections, Terminal, Jobs >>> execute actions in the background
- improved Japanese language input 
- CRAN {renv} >>> v.0.8.0 release
- within environment >>> packages installed within that environment only
-- creates a symbolic link to the package from/to the opened project environment
- "Use renv with this project" as new "Create new project" option 
- `renv::init()`
- Basically improve on old {packrat} pkg
-- Isolated: 
-- Portable: "lock" json file saves the pkg version 
-- Reproducible: leaves history within git commit 
- renv environment >>> global package cache >>> PJ private library (renv lock file)
- `init()` >>> `install()` >>> `status()` >>> `snapshot()` (create lock file)
- use `restore()` to create saved environment in a new place
- gives warning that "installed but not recorded in lockfile" >> recommends use `snapshot()` to save pkg into the lock files!
-- helpful messages!!
- warning: sf/ js, new R version can lead to failure
- no need to maintain a dockerfile >>> version in docker host and container are the same!
- {pins}: reading in different web data sources
-- `download.file()`? API ? Specific R pkgs? Mnay options
-- how about usage OFFLINE? 
- Not just tables but also OBJECTS?
- both R package AND Python library, 
- SHARE data locally, kaggle, github, rstudio connect
- `board_register()` WHICH service to use
- `pin()` create pin, `pin_get()` to get pinned data, `pin_find()` 
- from Connections panel in RStudio 
- can grab data from within other packages stored locally via pins
- {reticulate}: use Python with R/RStudio
-- `reticulate::repl_python()`
-- R Markdown engine 
-- RStudio terminal
- can use with {renv} to store python libraries
- use python spatial data >>> R for plotting + vice-versa


## [kazutan](https://twitter.com/kazutan): Weekly KPI reports with confluence and R!
* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/kazutan/zhou-ci-kpirepotowoconfluenceheupsurutameniyatutakoto)

- https://github.com/line/conflr
- uploading weekly KPI reports using CONFLUENCE
-- want to see more long term trends, want to examine outliers, want to see future forecasts
- UU, visits, other data...
-- calculate/collate, modeling, create report and place in nice secure space for stakeholders to easily access
- all data is in DB >>> BIG DATA! inability to grab data in a single simple query
-- SQL >>> tidy with R >>> then create nice tables 
- modeling: use "prophet"
- report creation: 
-- ggplot2 + R markdown
-- setting: confluence via the {conflr} pkg
- get logs > calculate KPI > fit/predict >>> create report >> upload >> confluence wiki
- {glue} + {purrr} for creating SQL queries (with different parameters)
- `between {start_date} AND {end_date}` >>> define specific dates in `glue()` call
-- use {purrr} `map()` to iterate over many dates/weeks/etc. 
- in-company {line.r} package
- `nest()` >>> prophet modeling
- Creating reports with {conflr}
- create custom ggplot 2 functions >>> use a lot == create your own pkg
- Setting up a report RMD
-- load data in "setup" chunk
- WHERE to place reports?    CONFLUENCE
- All documentation in one wiki!
- `rmarkdown::render()` >>> upload + post directly to Confluence with {conflr} pkg
- wrapper around the Confluence API >>> RStudio Addin
- automate with Jenkins / drone
-
- why not shiny? server maintenance + slow with lots of data, authentication problems

# Food, Drinks, and Conclusion

`TokyoR` happens almost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle with Japanese R users as it's the largest regular meetup here in Japan. The next meetup will be in [January](https://tokyor.connpass.com/) as on December 7th, there will be the [Japan.R meetup](https://japanr.connpass.com/)! You can check out what happened at last year's edition [here](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2018-12-06-japanr-conference-roundup-blog-post/).

Talks in English are also welcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
