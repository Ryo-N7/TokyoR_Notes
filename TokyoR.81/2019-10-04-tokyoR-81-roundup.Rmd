As another sweltering summer ends, another TokyoR Meetup! With global warming in full swing and it still being around 30 degrees at the end of September, this month's meetup was held at [DIP Corporation](https://www.dip-net.co.jp/), an personnel/recruitment services company, in their headquarters in Roppongi, Tokyo.

In line with my previous round up posts:

- [TokyoR #76](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-03-07-tokyoR-76-roundup/)
- [TokyoR #77](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77/)) 
- [TokyoR #78](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-05-31-tokyoR-78-roundup/) 
- [TokyoR #79](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup/)
- [TokyoR #80](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup/)

I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my efforts will help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider R community. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links from other sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic of a certain talk. You can follow __Tokyo.R__ by searching for the [#TokyoR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokyoR) hashtag on Twitter.

Anyways...

Let's get started!

# BeginneR Session

As with every [TokyoR](http://tokyor.connpass.com/) meetup, we began with a set of beginner user focused talks:

- [R Basics by kilometer0101](https://speakerdeck.com/kilometer/tokyo-dot-r-number-81-introduction-and-demonstration)
- [Shiny for Beginners by kyyonko](https://speakerdeck.com/kyyonko/di-81hui-tokyor-chu-xin-zhe-setusiyon2-hazimetefalseshiny-80e4f56b-198d-4d7d-a4e0-df1097aa226d)

# Main Talks

## [hoxo_m](https://twitter.com/hoxo_m): Asynchronous Programming for Shiny!
* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/hoxo_m/shiny-177170789)

- Asynchronous programming with Shiny
- Synchronous programming: run code one line at a time
- R: single-threadded programming language
- for most of time, single-threaded/single-user 
- but now with SHINY APPS >>> necessity to cater to multiple users at the same time!
- currently: chop up tasks into small components and trade between user A, B, C, etc. in tandem!
- But what about LONG / resource-intensive tasks (getting data from APIs?), thsi means other users have to WAIT even for short/quick tasks 
-- asynchronous: place these tasks in another process and free up time for other user's tasks, reduce responsiveness + waiting time
- use {promises}, {future}: https://rstudio.github.io/promises/articles/shiny.html
- use {promise} pipeline with `%...>%` pipe!
- `future({ long_task }) %...>%`
- {future} pkg
- insert long-task code INTO `future()` function 
- `plan()` 
-- multisession:
-- multicore:
-- multiprosess:
- how to grab the results from another process?
- {promise}: `render_*()` can take promises
-- promise: an object that takes a result from an asynchronous process that happens later/slightly later
-- takes the result from {future} pkg code result
-- "promise", until the result from "future" appears, it will WAIT until it appears/runs
-- `future` is NOT a data frame so can not `filter()`, so must use the "promise pipe" `%...>%` and then code!!
- Application to Shiny apps
-- can't use reactives inside a `future()`, need to create as object BEFORE and pass that through!
-- need to think about WHERE (which process?) the code is running 
-- can't put `plot()`/`print()` code inside the `future()` process, must promise pipe!
-- if reactive is in FUTURE >>> then subsequent code using that object must be promise-piped!

## [Np_Ur](https://twitter.com/Np_Ur_): A Simple Shiny App in 30 Minutes!
* [Slides](https://github.com/chan-ume/tokyoR81)

- how to build a shiny app in 30 minutes!!
- >> choose data set and visualize 
- >> choose data set and run a regression
- navbarpage (navigation bar)
-- `navbarPage("title", tabPanel(), tabPanel(), navbarMenu(), etc. etc.)`
- tabsetPanel (tabs)
-- `tabsetPanel(tabPanel(), tabPanel(), etc.)`
- built like 1000 different apps showing each step of creating  a shiny app (!)

## [kashitan](https://twitter.com/kashitan/): Making {shiny} Maps with {leaflet}!
* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/kashitan/shinyleaflettips-177070514)

`@kashitan` presented some tips (that you normally won't see in books/articles) for using {leaflet} with Shiny for map applications! He tooks us through four different functions that he found very useful for making {leaflet} maps with Japan census data. 

- Census viewer
- `updateSelectInput()`: multiple choices

- `leafletProxy()`

- `fitBounds()`

- `input${id}shape_click`


- [RStudio's {leaflet} Guide](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)
- [Leaflet in R: Tips & Tricks for Interactive Maps - Jindřich Lacko ](https://www.jla-data.net/eng/leaflet-in-r-tips-and-tricks/index.html)

## [okiyuki](https://twitter.com/okiyuki99): Software Engineering for Shiny!
* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/okiyuki99/190928-tokyor81-shiny)

- Software engineering for supporting shiny apps!
- {memoise}: cache data when certain function is run for the first time (useful for dashboard shiny apps where similar use cases can be predicted)
-- cache data in certain file/directory 
- {pool}: insert/access SQL database connection info, close when app closes!
- {ShinyProxy}
- {Shinyloadtest}

## [igjit](https://twitter.com/igjit): Edit Your Photos with {shinyroom}!
* [Slides](https://igjit.github.io/slides/2019/09/shinyroom/#/)

You might remember from a few months back, `@igjit` presented on "RAW image processing with R" ([TokyoR #79](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup/)). Continuing where he left off he decided to create a photo-editing UI using the power of {shiny}. Motivated by comments following the previous presentation, `@igjit` decided to base it on "Adobe Lightroom", and call it the {shinyroom} package. You can take a look at it [here](https://shinyroom.herokuapp.com/). 

![]()

In terms of actually building the Shiny app he used the {imager} package for the actual photo editing functionality while {golem} was used as the package framework for the app. For appearances `@igjit` used the {shinythemes} package

During the course of building the app, `@igjit` came across a peculiar problem concerning the screen when the Shiny app was busy. By default, a particular panel becomes slightly opaque when the server is busy doing stuff in the background but this is annoying when you are working on editing images. To get around this problem, `@igjit` created another package called {shinyloadermessage} so that instead of the screen greying out a small message will appear instead.

- [{shinybusy}: For minimal busy indicator in Shiny apps](https://github.com/dreamRs/shinybusy)

## [flaty13](https://twitter.com/flaty13): Reproducible Shiny with {shinymeta}!
* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aHRVEE05L7HO90TsTTFNsJZsVH-oI2umYlNR3NuXbac/edit)

`@flaty13` talked about the recently made public {shinymeta} package and reproducibility with Shiny apps. This is a topic that has taken a while to develop due to the complexity of the issue, where the end goal was to find a way to document and describe the actions of users who interacted with very dynamic Shiny apps with many different features. With the {shinymeta} package you can now download R scripts highlight the steps you took in interacting with the app.

The next step that is currently in development is to output an `.RMD` report among a number of other features as the package is still in the experimental phase. See the resources below for more details, especially Joe Cheng's keynote for all the stuff under-the-hood that's making this exciting new development possible!

# Food, Drinks, and Conclusion

`TokyoR` happens almost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle with Japanese R users as it's the largest regular meetup here in Japan. The next meetup will be on October 26 and I will also be one of the presenters!

Talks in English are also welcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
