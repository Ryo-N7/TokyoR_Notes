As the monsoon season (finally) ends, another TokyoR meetup! Since COVID hit all of TokyoR's meetups since February have been done online and the transition has been seamless thanks to the efforts of the TokyoR organizing team.

In line with my previous round up posts:

- [TokyoR #76: February 2019](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-03-07-tokyoR-76-roundup/)
- [TokyoR #77: April 2019](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77/)) 
- [TokyoR #78: May 2019](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-05-31-tokyoR-78-roundup/) 
- [TokyoR #79: June 2019](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup/)
- [TokyoR #80: July 2019](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-08-02-tokyoR-80-roundup/)

I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my efforts will help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider R community. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links from other sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic of a certain talk. You can follow __Tokyo.R__ by searching for the [#TokyoR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokyoR) hashtag on Twitter.

Anyways...

Let's get started!

# BeginneR Session

As with every [TokyoR](http://tokyor.connpass.com/) meetup, we began with a set of beginner user focused talks:

- [Data tidying by @y__mattu](https://ymattu.github.io/TokyoR87/slide.html#/)
- [Data visualization by @yuta_kanzawa](https://ytknzw.github.io/TokyoR/%E5%88%9D%E5%BF%83%E8%80%85%E3%82%BB%E3%83%83%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B3_%E3%83%87%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E5%8F%AF%E8%A6%96%E5%8C%96_TokyoR_20200801.pdf)


# Main Talks

## [u_ribo](https://twitter.com/u_ribo): Let's learn {data.table}!
* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/s_uryu/datatable1130)

@u_ribo gave an introduction to the {data.table} package. The {data.table} package is a package that extends `data.frame`s and allows you to do data manipulation very fast. @u_ribo's slides were very easy to understand and is probably a very good intro to {data.table} for tidyverse users as the walkthrough included side-by-side comparisons with similar dplyr and tidyr syntax (shown in detail below).

The 3 main differences he made to contrast with {dplyr} were:
* Lower # of dependencies: {data.table} only uses {methods}
* Lower memory usage: deep-copy {dplyr} vs. shallow-copy {data.table}
* "Conservative" development: Tries to minimize the amount of breaking changes in the code

# Lightning Talks

## [soupcurry049](https://twitter.com/soupcurry049/): Introduction to {ggspatial}!
* [Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/kashitan/shinyleaflettips-177070514)

@soupcurry049 gave a introduction to the {ggspatial} package which provides the user with ggplot-like style for plotting spatial data. It supports `sf`, `sp`, and `raster` objects and you have a lot of cool options for annotations (spatial lines, a NORTH arrow, etc.), layers, spatial geometries (in `ggplot2::geom_*()` style). @soupcurry049 finished off the LT with a quick demonstration of a map showing Onsen locations in Hokkaido prefecture.

## [andrew_cb2](https://twitter.com/andrew_cb2/): (x) => x + 1
* [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/andycraig/x-equals-x-plus-1)

`@andrew_cb2` talked about ... not programming IN R but programming R itself. Currently in R the syntax for creating a function requires typing out `function(...) ...` but typing all 8 letters every time can be annoying, couldn't there be a way to make it shorter? Recently there has been talk about creating a shorter anonymous function syntax and the following 3 styles were discussed:

The reason why some implementations are harder than others is due to the location of the special characters and R. `@andrew_cb2` then gave us a quick tutorial of going into the R source files and adding in your own anonymous function syntax into R.

`@andrew_cb2` has made the entire tutorial available on Github [here](https://github.com/andycraig/r-anonymous-functions).


## [flaty13](https://twitter.com/flaty13/): Data Science 100 Knocks!
* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12ldjAA1IOWkbOhUtOmLL__IK1ANYFj4Z9_gJMYu7Z0Q/edit#slide=id.g8de40d2099_0_159)

`@flaty13` talked about a new initiative by the Japan Data Science Society, the Data Science 100 Knocks for Data Pre-processing. It is a series of problem solving exercises meant for beginner and intermediate data scientists to practice their data pre-processing/handling skills in `SQL`, `Python`, and `R`. The problems are all contained in a Docker container so you are able to learn how to use it as well.

## [kozo2](https://twitter.com/kozo2/): Introduction to BioConductor!
* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sISzZurAxCYYJbsgHzVPiYgVYbv8HoBVLq7E-b3huAg/edit#slide=id.p)

@kozo2 introduced Bioconductor and its community. Bioconductor is a package repository for bioinfomatics much like CRAN for most R users. @kozo2 talked about a number of differences with CRAN including: 

* Rigid code review
* Bioconductor coding style
* Github based package submission and updating

To develop the local Japanese community, the [Bio-Pack-athon](https://biopackathon.connpass.com/) monthly meetup was created which helps bioinfomatics developers with ideas and workflows to nurture future Bioconductor authors. One of the bigger goals of this meetup is to increase the number of Bioconductor devs in Japan so that Tokyo could be a candidate to host the Bioc Asia conference in 2021.

Earlier this year, a Community Advisor Board was created which aims to support training, outreach, and promote cooperation between users and developers.

# Conclusion

`TokyoR` happens almost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle with Japanese R users as it's the largest regular meetup here in Japan. The next meetup will be in [January](https://tokyor.connpass.com/) 

For the time being meetups will continue to be conducted online. Talks in English are also welcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
