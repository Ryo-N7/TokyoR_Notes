Within a typhoon, another TokyoR Meetup! ... well not really it turned out to be a false alarm and the weather was a wonderful 30 degrees Celsius with 800% humidity as usual. My gripes with the weather aside this month's meetup was held at [Cresco](), a , in their headquarters in Shinagawa, Tokyo.

In line with my previous round up posts:

- [TokyoR #76](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-03-07-tokyoR-76-roundup/)
- [TokyoR #77](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77/)) 
- [TokyoR #78](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-05-31-tokyoR-78-roundup/) 
- [TokyoR #79](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-07-05-tokyoR-79-roundup/)

I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my efforts will help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider R community. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links from other sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic of a certain talk. You can follow __Tokyo.R__ by searching for the [#TokyoR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokyoR) hashtag on Twitter.

Anyways...

Let's get started!

# BeginneR Session

As with every [TokyoR](http://tokyor.connpass.com/) meetup, we began with a set of beginner user focused talks:

- [Reading in data with R by kotatyamtema](https://www.slideshare.net/kotora_0507/tokyor79-beginnerssession1/kotora_0507/tokyor79-beginnerssession1)
- [Data handling & manipulation by y_mattu](https://ymattu.github.io/TokyoR80/slide.html)

## 17:40 - 18:10 	@kilometer00 	R interface to Python 	[資料]

TokyoR organizer and frequent BeginneR session speaker `@kilometer00` talked about using Python with R. 

To familiarize the audience with Python he went over quite a number of slides showing the similarities and differences in syntax between the two languages.

- differences in programming with R vs. Python (var assignment, var naming, var type, etc.)
- {reticulate}
- isolated + independent environment >>> sandboxed Python in virtual environment 
-- security + reproducibility
- `Pipenv` >>> sandboxed python manager 
-- create virtualenv
- install.package(reticulate)
-- attach the python virtualenv! >>> `use_python()`
-- `py_config()` check your version, other sessionInfo
- `source_python()` >>> import python source file
- benchmark test for reading in csv files
- use Python in RMD: ```{python}   import pandas as pd blahblah ```
-- share py-object between chunks!
- import R object to a Python chunk using prefix `r.ObjectName`
- import python object to R chunk
- Using python interactively within an R session
- `reticulate::repl_python()` 
`>>> a = 1 `
`>>> import pandas as pd`
`>>>> df = r.iris`
`>>> ESC`  escape back to R!
`>>> import pyper` Run R in Python in R!!
`>>> r = pyper.R()`
`>>> r("set.seed(71)")`
