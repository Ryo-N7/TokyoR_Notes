With the arrival of summer, another [TokyoR User Meetup](https://tokyor.connpass.com/event/130254/)!  On May 25th, useRs from all over Tokyo (and some even from further afield - including Kan Nishida of [Exploratory](https://exploratory.io/), all the way from California!) flocked to Jimbocho, Tokyo for another jam-packed session of #rstats hosted by [Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group](https://www.ms-ins.com/english/).

Like my previous round up posts (for [TokyoR #76](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-03-07-tokyoR-76-roundup/) and [TokyoR #77](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77/)) I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my efforts will help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider R community. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links from other sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic of a certain talk. You can follow __Tokyo.R__ by searching for the [#TokyoR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokyoR) hashtag on Twitter.

# BeginneR Session #1

As with every [TokyoR](http://tokyor.connpass.com/) meetup, we began with a set of beginner user focused talks:

- [Reading in data with R by y_mattu](https://github.com/ymattu/TokyoR78)
- [Visualization with R by koriakane](https://speakerdeck.com/nozomi_miyazaki/tokyo-dot-r-number-77-chu-xin-zhe-setusiyon1-ke-shi-hua-pato)
- [Data analysis with R by kilometer00](https://speakerdeck.com/kilometer/tokyo-dot-r-number-78-beginnersession-data-analysis)

# Main Talks

## @tanakafreelance 	Radiantによるデータ分析入門 	[](https://www.slideshare.net/ssuser5aee94/78th-tokyor-radiant)

`@tanakafreelance` talked about [Radiant](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/), which is a platform-independent browser-based GUI for business analytics that was developed by [Vincent Nijs](). It is a tool for business analytics purposes and is based on `Shiny`. After installation from CRAN you can launch it via using `radiant::launcher()`. Most of this presentation was a live demo by `@tanakafreelance` show a lot of the functionality offered by Radiant such as creating reproducible reports with RMarkdown, writing your own R code to use within the GUI, creating and evaluating models (linear/logistic regression, neural networks, naive bayes, and more), and design of experiments (DOE)!

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7L3hDpLw53I/maxresdefault.jpg)

You can run it from a variety of set ups from online, offline, on shinyapps.io, shiny server, and even on the cloud service such as AWS via a customized Docker container. For a comprehensive introduction to Radiant's full capabilities you can check out its awesome website [here](https://radiant-rstats.github.io/docs/index.html) full of videos and vignettes!

- Using R in teams (intra-company R packages)
- engineer SE/SI more rather than data analysts >>> skillset for starting a data analytics pipeline in a company!
- problems: 
-- tasks / tool mismatch
-- NO reproducibility!
-- 
- Converting everyone to using R at VALUES
-- difficulty connecting to ODBC directly... other security problems...
-- new entry employees with NO programming experience >> R workshops!
-- 3 months of hard work >>> tidyverse usage!
- 80% of company employees can now use R!!

## @tomkxy 	Making your code faster: Introduction to vectorisation and parallel computing (English with demonstrations) [](https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/TokyoR78)

`@tomkxy` presented in English (he's a Kiwi that works for RIKEN!) on vectorizing your code and parallel computing with R. In direct response to a lot of the accusations that "R is slow", Tom talked about different techniques to use to make your R code faster along with some demonstrations.

"Code first, optimize later!"

The newly developed "Jobs" pane in RStudio


- loops in R? >>> create own ad-hoc functions to automate tasks
- VECTORIZE code and apply function to process vectors, matrices and lists ^^ efficiently
- PASS functions to other languages, esp. C++ with Rcpp
-- NO Copy-paste
-- only use loops when needed
-- AVOID premature optimization >>> code first THEN speed up later if needed
-- parallel computing with `snow` package
- `makeCluster()` to set number of cores to use... set for less cores than your total
- time needed to set up the clusters >>> ONLY use it if you have lots of complex tasks!
- if make cluster bigger than your machine, clusters compete with eachother and make the code runs slower!
-

## @Atsushi776 	May I felp you? 	[](https://presentation.atusy.net/20190525-tokyor76-felp/#/)

Annoyed that he can't look at the source code when looking at the help files of a function as well as the added annoyance of having to jump back to the start of the function to type `?` back in AND deleting it once you're done `@Atsushi776` created a new package called [felp](https://github.com/atusy/felp).

```{r eval=FALSE}
source("https://install-github.me/atusy/felp")
library(felp)
library(printr)

## From this:
?help()

## To this:
help?
## Alternatively:
felp(help)
felp("help")
```

```{r}
## Source code is nicely highlighted:
grep()?.
```

Short for __f__ unctional h __elp__, he got this to work by turning the `?` into a S3 object and using `prettycode` for the syntax highlighting. You can also use the `?` on dataset objects to return what you'll normally get from a `str()` call in addition the the help page.

```{r}
iris?. ## also opens "Help" page for the dataset
```

In the near future `@Atsushi776` wants to get rid of not just the `.` but the `?` altogether and wants to work on using a prefix `p?` in front of a package like `dplyr` to bring up the documentation for an entire package.

# Food, Drinks, and Conclusion

Following all of the talks, those who were staying for the after-party were served sushi and drinks! With a loud rendition of "kampai!" (cheers!) R users from all over Tokyo began to talk about their successes and struggles with R. A fun tradition at `TokyoR` is a __Rock-Paper-Scissors__ tournament with the prize being free data science books!

The prizes for this month was: 

- [Pandas for Everyone](https://github.com/chendaniely/pandas_for_everyone) by [Daniel Chen](https://twitter.com/chendaniely) provided by [Tom Kelly](https://twitter.com/tomkXY)

`TokyoR` happens almost monthly and it’s a great way to mingle with Japanese R users as it's the largest regular meetup here in Japan. Talks in English are also welcome so if you’re ever in Tokyo come join us!
