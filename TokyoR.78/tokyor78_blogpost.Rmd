EXTRA TALK SESSION

With the arrival of summer, another [TokyoR User Meetup](https://tokyor.connpass.com/event/130254/)!  On May 25th, useRs from all over Tokyo (and some even from further afield - including Kan Nishida of [Exploratory](https://exploratory.io/), all the way from California!) flocked to Jimbocho, Tokyo for a jam-packed session of #rstats.

Like my previous round up posts (for [TokyoR #76](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-03-07-tokyoR-76-roundup/) and [TokyoR #77](https://ryo-n7.github.io/2019-04-24-tokyoR-77/)) I will be going over around half of all the talks. Hopefully, my efforts will help spread the vast knowledge of Japanese R users to the wider R community. Throughout I will also post helpful blog posts and links from other sources if you are interested in learning more about the topic of a certain talk. You can follow __Tokyo.R__ by searching for the [#TokyoR](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TokyoR) hashtag on Twitter.

# BeginneR Session #1

Beginner user focused talks that happen at the start of every [TokyoR](http://tokyor.connpass.com/) meetup:

- [Reading in data with R by y_mattu](https://github.com/ymattu/TokyoR78)
- [Visualization with R by koriakane](https://speakerdeck.com/nozomi_miyazaki/tokyo-dot-r-number-77-chu-xin-zhe-setusiyon1-ke-shi-hua-pato)
- [Data analysis with R by kilometer00](https://speakerdeck.com/kilometer/tokyo-dot-r-number-78-beginnersession-data-analysis)

# Main Talks

- data analysis using Radiant (platform independent browser interface for business analytics)
- Shiny based GUI for EDA and reproducible reaserch 
-- used by MBA course at UCSD
- EDA: John Tukey
- install from CRAN! >>> Radiant website for dev version
- launch using `radiant::launcher()` !
- live code demo...
-- import data, plot data... modeling!
-- helpful tabs
-- create dashboards
-- knit report via RMarkdown

## @kotaku08 	R実務徹底活用な話（社内Rパッケージの話とか） 	[](https://speakerdeck.com/kosshi/r-package-for-a-team)

https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/using-r-packages-and-education-to-scale-data-science-at-airbnb-906faa58e12d

https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/scaling-knowledge-at-airbnb-875d73eff091

- Using R in teams (intra-company R packages)
- engineer SE/SI more rather than data analysts >>> skillset for starting a data analytics pipeline in a company!
- problems: 
-- tasks / tool mismatch
-- NO reproducibility!
-- 
- Converting everyone to using R at VALUES
-- difficulty connecting to ODBC directly... other security problems...
-- new entry employees with NO programming experience >> R workshops!
-- 3 months of hard work >>> tidyverse usage!
- 80% of company employees can now use R!!

## @tomkxy 	Making your code faster: Introduction to vectorisation and parallel computing (English with demonstrations) [](https://github.com/TomKellyGenetics/TokyoR78)

- loops in R? >>> create own ad-hoc functions to automate tasks
- VECTORIZE code and apply function to process vectors, matrices and lists ^^ efficiently
- PASS functions to other languages, esp. C++ with Rcpp
-- NO Copy-paste
-- only use loops when needed
-- AVOID premature optimization >>> code first THEN speed up later if needed
-- parallel computing with `snow` package
- `makeCluster()` to set number of cores to use... set for less cores than your total
- time needed to set up the clusters >>> ONLY use it if you have lots of complex tasks!
- if make cluster bigger than your machine, clusters compete with eachother and make the code runs slower!

# LTs

## @don_du_maru: Levenshtein distance 

- can't remember the region name of where i live....
- create a levenshtein distance list of region names
-- NItori <> tori, etc.
- use RMeCab data
- usage for product names and people's names

## @Atsushi776 	May I felp you? 	[](https://presentation.atusy.net/20190525-tokyor76-felp/#/)

- extremely annoying searching for documentation for a function by putting ? mark at the front of the function THEN deleting it 
- `felp()` package and function >>>>
-- put ? at the END 
-- ? as S3 object
- prettycode: syntax highlight
-- `saveHistory()`
- mask `?` as well!!!
- `p?dplyr` for PACKAGE documentation
- ?iris >> documentation + str() 
-- use `?.`
